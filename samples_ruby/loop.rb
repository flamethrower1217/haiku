def looping(num)
  # Your code goes here!
  # Directions: create an array, the array starts with [1] and ends with [num]
  # Example: num = 3, the answer is [1, 2, 3]
  # Hint, do not use puts!
end

# Hint, this will require a loop and array and (possibly) some addition
# It may also require you use a variable to store the array numbers
