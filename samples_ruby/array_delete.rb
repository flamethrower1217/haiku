def array_delete(arr, delete_value)
  # Your code goes here!
  # Directions: arr is an array, delete_value is a position in the array
  #  Delete the value located in delete_value position.
  # Example: arr = [1, 2, 3] delete_value = 0.
  #   The answer is [2, 3] because [1] was deleted from arr
  # Hint, do not use puts!
